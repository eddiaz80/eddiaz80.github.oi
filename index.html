                        <div id="what">
                    <p>Tae Kwon Do is a Korean martial art. While training is often vigorous, Tae Kwon Do teaches more
                        than just fighting skills. It is a discipline meant to enhance our spirit through physical
                        training. While our bodies are geared up in preparation for the world, so is our mind.
                    
                        <p>But before we get into that, letâ€™s take a step back.</p>
                    
                        <p>The Korean word Tae Kwon Do is composed of three parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tae means "foot"</li>
                        <li>Kwon means "fist"</li>
                        <li>Do means the "way" or "discipline." Together- the way of the hand and foot.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                       <p>Tae Kwon Do has a long history- stretching back hundreds of years, actually. It has gone by many
                        names in Korea. Over the years, it has been identified with other arts, since often there are
                        similar features. What sets Tae Kwon Do apart? Many things! It has a dynamic set of movements,
                        rich history of patterns passed on for years, and a very strong principle that follows the idea
                        that we are not strong until our mind is strong and at peace.</p>
                    
                        If we are unbalanced, we are without peace.
                        
                        <p>Tae Kwon Do can be characterized by unity: the unity of body, mind, and spirit. When practicing,
                        you should make your mind peaceful and synchronize your mind with your movements. This is done
                        through concentration. The idea is that if we can focus on matching the body to the mind while
                        training, we can extend this level of focus and discipline into life.</p>
                    
                        <p>That is the ultimate goal!</p>
                    
                        <p>If I can concentrate within my dojan, I can concentrate in school, during extracurricular
                        activities, or at my job. I can accomplish great things because I have grown strong in the art.</p>
                      
                        <p>Tae Kwon Do is a way of life. You can learn how to defend yourself through endless methods and
                        in countless locations.
                        When studying Tae Kwon Do, however, your mind is being prepared to take on the world. Your
                        confidence, awareness, compassion, strength, leadership ability, and spirit are all being honed
                        and polished on a daily basis.
                        Sometimes our enemies in life are not physical. The challenges of the world are often meant to
                        break us, but if we have a strong mind-set, we are indomitable. We are unbreakable.</p>

                        <div id="why">
                    <p>We believe in the individual: We celebrate our students' uniqueness. Not everyone is built the same and
                    so we shouldn't expect the same. This means that our constant goal, as instructors, is to discover what 
                    our students are capable of and push them to discover it for themselves. </p>

                    <p>Strong on the inside, first:  While we are always trying to make ourselves healthier and stronger physically, 
                    we strive to make all of our students stronger within. Our five main teachings 
                    (Respect, Self-Control, Balance, Confidence and the Indomitable Spirit) encourage a persistent build-up of 
                    character. What would be the point of knowing self-defense if you don't know when to do it, how excessive to be 
                    and how to appropriately reflect upon it? In a society where bullying is at an all-time high, we try to create a 
                    group of young people who can withstand pressure and deflect negativity that comes their way. </p>
